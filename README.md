# graduation_project_OR_ANAC
 Project developed for completion of graduation in Production Engineering at the University of Bras√≠lia (UNB). A comparison of Python, Jullia, AIMMS and LINGO software was developed using an Integer Programming (PI) model for allocation of inspectors from the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC). 
 
 The model considers the skills and availability of inspectors, the quantity and specification of each inspection, and the objective was to minimize the cost of airfare for transporting inspectors to carry out inspections.
 
 The graduation dissertation is presented in file [PG_MILP_ANAC_GabrielGuth](https://github.com/guthgabriel/graduation_project_OR_ANAC/blob/main/PG_MILP_ANAC_GabrielGuth.pdf "PG_MILP_ANAC_GabrielGuth"). 
 
 The codes developed in Python, Julia, LINGO and Heuristics for the model are in folder [Modelos](https://github.com/guthgabriel/graduation_project_OR_ANAC/tree/main/Modelos "Modelos").
